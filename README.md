This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Cloning the Repository

First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
    cd: to change your working directory.
    cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

git clone https://github.com/Shan121/booking.git

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
